Do you want to make a playgroand so we can share code and a leaner github with our study group?
now how to do the command, but I have never worked on a shared git repositorie

as i told elaine, my scrum lost his progress by a pull request mistake from other student, and in the future i dont want to be this guy kkkkkkk

what do you say? :)
